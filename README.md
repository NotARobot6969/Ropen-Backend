# FAQ
Q: Why can't I login?
A: This is an extremely early version of Ropen, and I'm trying to get logging in working right now. If you get it working, please make a PR!

Q: Why C#? It's, like, the worst language for backends.
A: I easily know C# better than any other language, so prototyping and implementing ideas is a much quicker process.

Q: Why is it constantly saying invalid username even though I signed up?
A: You need to download MongoDB, go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\MongoDB\5.0\bin\` and open `mongod.exe`.
